DDEV comes bundled with a predefined set of tools, `terminus` being one of them.
Latest releases of `terminus` are not compatible with older PHP versions, 
thus there is a need to downgrade the package inside DDEV.

This guide covers how and will also explain how to use the same technique to install
custom tools too.

Please note there are many ways to install packages in a container. We will 
cover [extra Dockerfiles](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/customizing-images/#adding-extra-dockerfiles-for-webimage-and-dbimage)
here, but also [check `webimage_extra_packages` and `dbimage_extra_packages` in your
`config.yaml`for more details](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/customizing-images/#adding-extra-debian-packages-with-webimage_extra_packages-and-dbimage_extra_packages)).

## Case study:Manually downgrading Terminus

[Terminus](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/releases) dropped
support for PHP 8.1 in newer versions which we still rely on in some of our
projects. We had to downgrade the DDEV bundled version of Terminus for those
projects by using a custom Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# .ddev/web-build/Dockerfile.terminus
# Terminus 4 drops support for PHP 8.1 which we still need
ARG TERMINUS_VERSION="3.6.2"
RUN curl -L --fail -o /usr/local/bin/terminus https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/releases/download/${TERMINUS_VERSION}/terminus.phar && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/terminus
```

`terminus` is just an example here, it could be any command you wish, 
[either because you are running an older PHP version](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/releases/tag/4.0.0)
or the bundled version [has a bug that ruins things for you](https://github.com/platformsh/cli/discussions/166).

## Installing custom tools

You can obviously use the same techniques to install a variety of custom tools:

```dockerfile
# .ddev/web-build/Dockerfile.fzf
# fooscript relies on fzf
# fooscript lists all your Pantheon projects using a fuzzy finder list
ARG FZF_VERSION="0.62.0"
RUN curl -s -L https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases/download/v${FZF_VERSION}/fzf-${FZF_VERSION}-linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar xvz -C /usr/local/bin/ && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fzf
```
